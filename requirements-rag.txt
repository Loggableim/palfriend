# Optional dependencies for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) features
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-rag.txt
# 
# Note: These dependencies require onnxruntime, which may not be available on all platforms.
# Specifically, Windows ARM and some other platforms may not have pre-built wheels.
# 
# If you encounter installation errors, the application will still work without these features.
# The RAG engine is optional and the application gracefully handles its absence.
